2. [+]GWR for Grid Downscaling :: 
2.1 [x]ensemble by dw_weighting 0,1,2,3 
- speed : 0,1,2,3 == ~1 min 
- detail: 0,1,2,3 == yes
- elevations: 0,1,2,3 == yes, there's variability 
> if all produce compareble results, then this is ensemble and not play with other param !
2.2 [x] add to the pipeline 
2.3 [@] add the new postprocessing (force_taget_min)
2.4 [x] ensemble avge and opte 
2.5 [x] run for block 
2.6 [] dictionary key:value to translate my-maning to rolf-naming and upload 

[] exclude other files from the analysis to save time 
[] can we save the model, and use it to make predictions ?
- no need as this stuff are locally weighted 

3. [] with with edit-ana and #canvas - strategyzer,made-with-ml,exeter
